This is a test file for _foundry_read_all_bytes().
It contains some text that we'll read using both g_file_get_contents()
and the _foundry_read_all_bytes() helper function.

The file should be read completely and the bytes should match exactly.
This includes newlines and any special characters.

Let's add some more content to make it a bit longer:
- Line 1
- Line 2
- Line 3
- Line 4
- Line 5

And some unicode: 🚀 🎉 ✨

End of test data.
