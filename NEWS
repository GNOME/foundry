Foundry 1.0.alpha
=================

This is the initial release of Foundry as I work towards getting the API in
place for a 1.0 release with GNOME 49.

The long term goal is for libfoundry to be a shared base library among many
developer tools in the GNOME eco-system such as Manuals, Builder, and Sysprof
with potentially more to follow.

There is a command line tool `foundry` which allows exercising much of the
libfoundry API.

There is also a libfoundry-gtk module that is not currently used by any
applications yet but will be in the future by GNOME Builder. It is not
necessary to build for GNOME 49 and distributions may want to choose to
build with `-Dgtk=false` to disable it.

Thanks!
