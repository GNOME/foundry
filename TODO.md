# Fallback Context

 * Foundry is very project oriented. However we could have a "fallback"
   context that is used when there is no `.foundry` available. This could
   make it easier to edit things in `~/Downloads/`, `/etc`, and similar.

   One aspect of that would be to disable recursive file-monitors as well
   as services that do code execution.

# CLI Commands

 * foundry debug
 * foundry profile
 * foundry valgrind
 * foundry pipeline target (list|switch)
 * foundry buildconfig ...

# Managers

 * File Manager
   * Try to avoid recursive monitors past X deep. Mark the project
     as degraded if we go past and require install before every
     run (as opposed to skipping if not).
   * Manage project tree data abstractions.
 * Operations Manager
 * Persistent Logging 
 * Debugger Manager
 * Code Action Manager
 * Search Manager
 * VCS Manager
 * Code Indexing

# Editing

 * GTK-less text iter engine so we can run foundry without a display
   and still have useful API for plug-ins.

   * GCC
   * Mono

# Project Templates

 * Make templates
 * Meson templates

# VCS
